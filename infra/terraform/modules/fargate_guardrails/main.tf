# NAT Gateway (COST TRAP) — demonstration only; keep disabled by default
#
# Why:
# - NAT Gateway has an hourly charge plus per-GB data processing charges.
# - It is one of the most common sources of unintended AWS spend.
#
# This block is intentionally left disabled so you can demonstrate
# that you understand how to provision it while also showing
# cost awareness and disciplined guardrails.
#
# If you choose to test:
# 1) Enable the toggle.
# 2) Provide a valid public subnet ID (after building a dedicated VPC).
# 3) Apply, verify, then destroy immediately.
#
# Do not leave NAT enabled unless actively required.
# ------------------------------------------------------------

# NOTE: A real NAT requires a VPC, public subnet, EIP, IGW, route table wiring.
# This is NOT being built that now (Currently using default VPC).
# When VPC is built later, This will be wired properly.
